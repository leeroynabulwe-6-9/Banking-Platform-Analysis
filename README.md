## Key Findings
Success rate is below optimal for stable fintech operations. 
Fraud is being detected but the transactions are not being blocked.
Latency fluctuations impact transaction completion. Higher latency is associated with higher failure rates.
The 5G Network slicing is not proving to be a worthwhile investment, users with higher network slices(Slice 1 and 2) higher transaction failure rates.
The Desktop portal seems to have more failure rates as compared to the mobile app therefore the app development resources should be focused on it.
## Recommendations
Strengthen fraud‑detection algorithms and early warning systems.
Optimize network slice load balancing to reduce latency.
Improve backend transaction retry mechanisms.
Implement continuous monitoring dashboards for real‑time alerts. 
Focus App Development resources towards the Desktop portal next quarter.
